mailman-suite (0+20170523-12) unstable; urgency=medium

  Binary package 'mailman3-suite' renamed to 'mailman3-web':

  To avoid further confusion, the binary package 'mailman3-suite' got
  renamed to 'mailman3-web'. We decided to not provide complex migration
  tools as the package is very young and has never been part of a stable
  release yet.

  In case you want to keep your existent mailman3-suite database, you're
  advised to make a backup now and re-import it after the installation of
  mailman3-web.
