Template: mailman3-web/nginx-choice
Type: note
_Description: Configuring Mailman3 in Nginx
 The Mailman3 Nginx configuration file is a vhost configuration. Hence,
 it comes with a server name which is set to mailman.example.com. You
 will have to change it properly.
 .
 Please also note that Mailman3 is configured to expect the web interface
 at URL subdirectory '/mailman3' per default. But in the nginx file, as
 the configuration includes a vhost, the expected URL root is '/'.
 .
 For the Nginx vhost configuration (without '/mailman3' subdomain) to
 work, you will have to edit the URL in 'base-url' at
 '/etc/mailman3/mailman-hyperkitty.cfg' and in 'MAILMAN_ARCHIVER_FROM'
 at '/etc/mailman3/mailman-web.py' accordingly.
 .
 See the comments in '/etc/mailman3/nginx.conf' for details.

Template: mailman3-web/restart-webserver
Type: boolean
Default: true
_Description: Should the webserver(s) be restarted now?
